<!-- Static Position: In CSS, the static position is the default positioning value for an element. When an element's position is set to static, it follows the normal flow of the document. It is positioned based on its order in the HTML markup and any other positioning or layout properties applied to it.
When an element has a static position, it is not affected by the positioning properties like top, bottom, left, or right. It remains in its default position within the document flow and is not explicitly offset or moved. -->


<!-- example is -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .box {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      background-color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box">Static</div>
</body>
</html>
