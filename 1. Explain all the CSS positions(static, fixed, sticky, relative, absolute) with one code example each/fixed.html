<!--
    In CSS, the fixed position is a positioning value used to position an element relative to the browser window, regardless of scrolling. When an element's position is set to fixed, it is positioned relative to the viewport and remains fixed in that position even when the page is scrolled.

Key characteristics of the fixed position:

Fixed to Viewport: An element with position: fixed is positioned relative to the browser viewport. It does not move when the page is scrolled.

Does Not Affect Document Flow: Elements with position: fixed are taken out of the normal document flow, meaning they don't affect the positioning of other elements.

Offset Properties: The top, bottom, left, and right properties can be used to define the exact position of the element within the viewport.
